//_gender: the _gender of the person (male / female)
//And the following member functions:
//
//introduce(): prints out "Hi, I'm name, a _age year old _gender."
//getGoal(): prints out "My goal is: Live for the moment!"
//And the following constructors:
//
//Person(name, _age, _gender)
//Person(): sets name to Jane Doe, _age to 30, _gender to female
//Student
//Create a Student class that has the same members and functions as the Person class, and has the following additional
